        <h2>IF YOU ARE READING THIS THEN YOU ARE DEAD</h2>
        <p>here are the answers to what we have determined to be some of the most frequently asked questions by souls in
            LIMBO.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>where is ‘the border of consciousness’?</h3>
        <p>
            LIMBO is located at the edge of existence and nonexistence, more commonly known as the subconscious realm or
            the border of consciousness. this is not a physical space, meaning that it does not exist as matter in any
            realm, dimension, or materially bound reality. you might recognize some things here; this is a common
            mistake. nothing at the border of consciousness exists, apart from the souls of those inhabiting it. time
            does not pass here, and anything resembling matter is a construction of your own subconscious, simply made
            manifest and visible to you via your existence within the border.
        </p>
        <p>for more information about the border of consciousness, and ways to spend your simultaneously eternal and
            momentary
            existence within it, <a href="/things-to-do">click here.</a></p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>if nothing exists, how am i accessing this webpage?</h3>
        <p>you’re not.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>why am i here?</h3>
        <p>you are here because there is nowhere else for your soul to go at the moment.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>what exactly am i waiting for?</h3>
        <p> you will know when it comes. in the meantime, feel free to explore LIMBO’s various amenities, or to just,
            you know, wait.</p>
        <p class=hidden-text>really, this is a question more of you should be asking yourselves rather than us, and
            sooner at that.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>am i in purgatory?</h3>
        <p>
            no. purgatory is an afterlife model based around redemption; it is for souls that have been granted a chance
            at
            purification via gruelling trials meant to cleanse the soul of minor earthly sins. you are in LIMBO, where
            you will
            wait indefinitely for your soul to be transferred somewhere else.
        </p>

        <h3>who are the architects?</h3>
        <p>
