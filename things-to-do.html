        <h2>IF YOU ARE READING THIS THEN YOU ARE DEAD</h2>
        <p>while LIMBO is defined by its liminal emptiness, your indefinite afterlife does not have to be spent in boredom (though it certainly can be)
            here are some of the activities that can take up your non-passing time here.
        </p>

        <h3>the computer room</h3>
        <picture><img src="images/computer-room.png" alt="a picture of the computer room"></picture>
        <p>this is where you are currently. because there is no wireless signal in LIMBO, on account of this not being a real place,
         these computers are only able to access a limited number of websites, files, and applications. these include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>this site</li>
            <li>entirety of wikipedia (without images)</li> 
            <li>all of the pornography you have ever consumed</li>
            <li>every photograph of you that has ever been taken</li> 
            <li>pong</li>
            <li><a href = "monuments.html">a searchable online catalogue of every book available in our library</a> </li>
        </ul>
        <p>access to the computer room is unlimited, but we request that you remain mindful of your usage. 
            there are an infinite number of nonexistent computers available for the souls inhabiting LIMBO, none of which you will ever encounter, 
            but remain mindful nonetheless. 
        </p>

            <h3>the library</h3>
            <picture>
                <img src="images/library.png" alt="a picture of the library">
            </picture>
            <p> by virtue of the fact that it does not exist and goes on forever, 
                LIMBO is proud to boast a collection of every book that has not been written. 
                this includes an infinite number of your biographies, memoirs, and the like. the library is organized to your interest, meaning that books
                will appear to you in the order determined most suitable to you by our architects. 
                the library is designed as one long corridor for your convenience, so you will not have to worry about potentially getting lost. 
                there is nowhere you can get lost in LIMBO; navigation is only a concern in real places. 
            </p>

            <p>LIMBO is not a dream, however, it inhabits the same non-space as dreams and other subconscious activities. 
                as such, you are able to freely explore the storehouse of your living mind. 
                your senses in this afterlife allow you to perceive ruins of your own earthly design, 
                and despite the fact that none of these ruins actually exist, 
                their exploration is nonetheless a deeply moving, introspective experience.
            </p>

            <p>in theory, it is possible to access the subconscious of souls still on the mortal plane, 
                albeit only in relation to your own presence; 
                in other words, you exist in the realm of everything that everyone has ever thought about you, ever. 
            </p>

            <p>as LIMBO’s landscape is ever-shifting, you will notice a lack of concrete landmarks, 
                other than those put in place by our architects as described earlier.
                 however, your earthly beliefs, intentions, values, dreams, fears, habits, and secrets will all shape your experience
                in the border of consciousness. nothing here can hurt you<a class="hidden-text" href="you.html">; it’s all you, after all</a> </p>
