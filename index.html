        <p>if you have access to this webpage, congratulations! you are among <em>the waiting dead</em>. you have been selected for an experimental new afterlife 
            model known as LIMBO. rather than a place of punishment or reward for your earthly deeds, 
            you have been placed in a transitory afterlife, existing on the border of consciousness. 
            unlike other models of the afterlife, LIMBO has been crafted to be both liminal and indefinite. 
            this means that your soul is in a state of perpetual waiting. you will remain in LIMBO until the time comes. </p>
